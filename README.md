# Scheduled-tasks-in-asp.net-with-quartz.net
In this article I am going to discuss how to scheduled background task in ASP.NET using Quartz.Net. If you are a .Net developer and asked to send emails once in 24 hours at a given time, what will you do? You may go to write Windows Services and install or write console application and schedule with the Task Scheduler. http://www.techstrikers.com/Articles/scheduled-tasks-in-asp.net-with-quartz.net.php
